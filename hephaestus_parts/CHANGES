  * highlight lines associated with edge when edge is selected on
    absorption page
  * add La2 line to filter plots

4 Oct 2007 0.18

    element with a K edge that is 90 eV above the La1 line
  * integrate heph chapter of Athena User's Guide
  * added doc to button bar
  * refactored code for switching between utilities
  * added Shaltout data to Xray::Absorption

14 Sep 2007 0.17
  * move font selection into the ini file
  * mucked around with layout issues
  * changed header text on transitions page

March 25, June 24 2007 0.16
  * added filter plot to absorption page
  * removed absorption calculation from absorption page
  * fill in formulas page when clicking an element on Data or
    Absorption pages
  * fixed a bug computing edge step lengths
  * added Mossbauer isotopes to the Data utility and kalziumrc file
  * fixed a stoopid bug using molarity on formulas page

June 7 2006 0.15
  * fixed a problem dealing with the ini files and the .horae directory

April 20 2006 0.14
  * Compute unit edge step lengths in formula utility
  * implemented an ini file
   
February 4 2006 0.13
  * fixed a problem in McMaster.pm returning zeros at very high energy
  * use mass energy-absorption coefficient in ion chamber utility for
    resources with photo and incoherent cross sections
  * warn when trying to use Henke tables above 30 keV
   
December 26 2005 0.12
  * fixed numerical error in computing photon flux in ion chamber
    utility
  * use HLists to display edge and line energies in absorption utility
  * changed font in several places
  * modified units swap to include new tables

August ?? 2005 0.11
  * add togles for total, photoelectric, coherent, and incoherent
    cross-sections and text to the formula report
  * fixed a bug in Elam.pm precluding the display of data about Np
    through Cf
  * added a label about resource and cross_section to periodic table,
    but only for absorption utility
  * finally figured out how to automatically zoom in on the pod text!

July 16 2005 0.10
  * added some pure metals to formula.dat
  * added molarities to formula utility
  * make sure the window is big enough for both the transitions chart
    and the periodic table
  * added photon flux calculation
  * fixed a plotting typo in f1f2 -- y-axis of f" plot was mis-labeled

April 29 2005 0.09
  * tightened up some code in head.pl to make it easier to add and
    maintain utilities.
  * some changes to how widgets are packed so that the program behaves
    reasonably well when resized
  * added a little script to the distro to generate html and pdf
    documentation 

March 17 2005 0.08
  * added a line finder
  * made the text a big bigger in the finder lists
  * come internal changes to color handling in the button box
  * added icons in various formats to the distro for use on the
    desktop
  * bound the mouse wheel to the listboxes in formulas and the finders
    

October 8 2004 0.07
  * fixed the disabled background color of the disabled entry boxes in
    ion and f1f2
  * added some text to the About box

September 28 2004 0.06 (svn r24)
  * in the entry boxes in the formula, ion chamber, and edge finder
    utilities, bound the return key to do the calculation
  * added file export to f'/f"
  * updated pod

July 27 -- August 2 2004 0.05 (svn r13)
  * TRANSFER TO SUBVERSION
  * added the edge finder utility
  * fixed a bug in how pressure was used in the ion utility
  * added energy and density units to the formula utility
  * formula utility now computes the mass needed for one absorption
    length even if the density of the sample is not provided.
  * for some inscrutable reason, I had commented out the report of the
    mass needed for an absorption length if the absorption length was
    quite long
  * added a reset button to the ion chamber utility
  * changed the button color scheme
  * made formula results area an ROtext and disabled the mouse-3 menu

    utilities 

July 10 2004 0.04
