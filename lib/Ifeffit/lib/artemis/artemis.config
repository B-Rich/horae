section_description
  These variables determine aspects of the overall behavior of Artemis.

variable=query_save
type=boolean
default=true
onvalue=1
description
  When this variable is true, Artemis will always ask you if you want
  to save your current project before quitting the program.

variable=autosave_policy
type=list
values=realsave autosave none
default=autosave
description
  This variable instructs Artemis how to perform an autosave event.
  This event happens just before any major function, such as a feff
  run, a fit, or a number of other things.  The default is to perform
  an autosave, which saves a copy of the current project in a special
  location on disk.  This special file is deleted when Artemis is
  exited normally.  If Artemis should ever crash, you will be given
  the opportunity to load the autosave file the next time you start
  up.  The other options are to save the project to its project file
  or to do nothing at all.  These other two options effectively
  disable the crash protection feature.

variable=fit_query
type=boolean
default=true
onvalue=1
description
  When this variable is true, Artemis will prompt for information
  about a fit before the fit begins.  This information includes the
  label to be used in the Path list, a comment line describing the fit
  which will be inserted in the project properties, and a value.  The
  value is a single number (or possibly a string) which describes the
  fit.  An example would be for a temperature series, the value would
  be the temperature of the data used in the fit.  The value is useful
  in the log parsing tool.  Setting this to false means that the
  dialog for setting these parameters will be skipped and default
  values will be used.

variable=sort_sets
type=boolean
default=true
onvalue=1
description
  When this variable is true, Artemis will sort the set variables used in a
  fit so that they are sent to Ifeffit in an order that assures that no
  variable which is used in another set variable's math expression is
  undefined at the time the other variable is set.  The only reason to make
  this variable false is if you completely understand how Ifeffit handles set
  and def variables and you have an explicit reason for defining set variables
  in some other order.
  
variable=mru_limit
type=positive integer
default=8
description
  The length of the history of the most recently used files for
  Artemis to remember and display in the "Files->Recent files" menu.

variable=mru_display
type=list
values=full name
default=full
description
  This tells Artemis how to display files in the Recent Files menu.
  "full" means to display the fully resolved filenames, "name" means
  to strip the path and just display the name of the file.

variable=doc_zoom
type=positive integer
default=4
maxint=8
description
  The tool used to view the documentation defaults to a very tiny font
  for some inscrutible reason.  This parameter is used to zoom in on
  the document view, making the document rather more legible.  The
  value of this parameter tells Athena how many steps to zoom in.
  This should probably be an even number.

# variable=workspace
# type=folder
# default=~/.horae/stash/
# windows=ENV___IFEFFIT_DIR___\\horae\\stash\\
# description
#   This is the location on disk where Artemis does all its work.  A
#   project will be assembled in a subfolder to the folder specified by
#   this variable.

variable=remember_cwd
type=boolean
onvalue=1
default=false
description
  This tells Artemis to start up in the current directory that was in-use in
  the last Artemis session.


variable=mac_eol
type=list
values=fix skip
default=fix
description
  This tells Artemis what to do when it attempts to import a file with
  Macintosh end-of-line characters.  This is needed because Ifeffit
  may not correctly interpret files those files.  The options are to
  fix the file by overwriting it with Unix end-of-line characters or
  to skip the file and not import it.  The end-of-line conversion does
  not otherwise change the data.  If you do not want the end-of-line
  characters changed, then you should choose the skip option.  But be
  forewarned that this washing is done on feffNNNN.dat files as well
  as on data.  If you choose to skip files and your feffNNNN.dat files
  need washing, then you will end up without those paths in your
  project. 

variable=layout
type=list
values=mlp mpl lmp lpm pml plm
default=mlp
description
   The layout, displaying left to right, of Artemis.  m=main window,
   l=list of data and paths, p=plotting.  Thus the options are
   .  mlp   main list plot
   .  mpl   main plot list
   .  lmp   list main plot
   .  lpm   list plot main
   .  pml   plot main list
   .  plm   plot list main

variable=projectbar
type=list
values=file title
default=file
description
  This variable tells what information is displayed in the project
  bar, which is located right below the menu bar.  The default is to
  display the project file name.  Choosing "title" says to display the
  project title from the project properties in the that space.

# variable=projectbar
# type=list
# values=file title none
# default=file
# description
#   This variable tells what information is displayed in the project
#   bar, which is located right below the menu bar.  The default is to
#   display the project file name.  Choosing "title" says to display the
#   project title from the project properties in the that space.  "None"
#   means to not display the project bar at all.
# 

variable=print_spooler
type=string
default=lpr
windows=""
description
  This is the command for sending something to the printer.  This
  variable is not used on Windows.

variable=ps_device
type=string
default=/cps
description
  This is the prefered format for printing plots.  The value must be a
  output device recognized by PGPLOT.  Common values are
  .  /ps    b&w postscript (landscape)
  .  /vps   b&w postscript (portrait)
  .  /cps   color postscript (landscape)
  .  /vcps  color postscript (portrait)

variable=import_feffit
type=boolean
default=false
onvalue=1
offvalue=0
description
  When this is true, the entry in the File menu for importing a
  feffit input file will be enabled.  Since there is no other way to
  use this feature of Artemis, this variable must be true in order to
  import a feffit input file.  Note that this is a HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL
  feature.  It is guaranteed to work only on the examples that I have
  tried.  Your mileage will vary.  If this is valuable feature for
  you, I encourage you to send me feffit input files that fail --
  preferably pared down to the simplest form that demonstrates the
  failure.


######################################################################
section=geometry
section_description
  These parameters provide a mechanism for controlling the size of the
  Artemis on the screen and of certain items within the Artemis
  window.

variable=window_multiplier
type=real
default=1.07
windows=1.0
description
  When the Artemis window is stretched horizontally, only the Data and
  Paths list becomes wider.  This number is the amount that Artemis
  will be stretched at start-up.  A number smaller than 1 will be
  reset to 1.  A number larger than about 1.15 will probably be too
  wide for the monitor.

variable=main_width
type=real
default=14
windows=13.5
units=centimeters
description
  This parameter is the width of the main portion of the Artemis
  window.  Since the starting widths of the Data and Paths List panel
  and the plotting panel are hard-wired at start-up, this parameter
  determines the overall width of the Artemis window.

variable=main_height
type=real
default=16.5
windows=15.5
units=centimeters
description
  This parameter is the height of the main portion of the Artemis
  window.  The Data and Paths List panel and the plotting panel will
  expand to fit this height.

######################################################################
section=plot
section_description
  These variables determine the features of plots made by Artemis.
  Colors can be named colors from X11's rgb.txt file, any other named
  colors that your system recognizes, or hexadecimal triplets
  (i.e. "#0000FF" for blue and so on).

variable=charsize
type=real
default=1.2
description
  This sets the size of the font used in the plots.  Very large and
  very small values will result in strange plots.  Anything smaller
  than 0.75 will result in nearly illegible text.  Any thing smaller
  than 0 will result in axes and axis labels not being drawn.  Text
  larger than 2 may be useful, but since fine control over the spacing
  between tics is not provided by Athena, such large text tends to
  result in tic labels that run together.

variable=charfont
type=positive integer
default=1
minint=1
maxint=4
description
  This is an integer that indicates the type of font to use in the
  plots.  The font choices are
  . 1   sans serif
  . 2   roman
  . 3   italic
  . 4   script

variable=key_x
type=real
default=0.8
units=fraction of the plot width
description
  This variable is for customizing the location of the legend in an
  ifeffit plot.  This parameter specifies the location of the legend
  on the x-axis.  This customization was introduced in Ifeffit 1.2.6
  and has no effect on earlier versions.

variable=key_y
type=real
default=0.9
units=fraction of the plot height
description
  This variable is for customizing the location of the legend in an
  ifeffit plot.  This parameter specifies the top of the legend on the
  y-axis.  This customization was introduced in Ifeffit 1.2.6 and has
  no effect on earlier versions.

variable=key_dy
type=real
default=0.075
units=fraction of the plot height
description
  This variable is for customizing the location of the legend in an
  ifeffit plot.  This parameter specifies the offset in y between
  entries in the legend.  This customization was introduced in Ifeffit
  1.2.6 and has no effect on earlier versions.

variable=plot_phase
type=boolean
onvalue=1
default=false
restart=1
description
  Setting this variable to true tells Artemis to show a radiobutton
  for plotting the phase of the chi(R) or chi(q) spectra.  Because
  phase plots are rarely helpful in interpreting fit quality, the
  default is to not show this button in order to conserve space in the
  plotting panel.

variable=window_multiplier
type=real
default=1.05
description
  When a window function is plotted along with data, the window will
  be taller than the height of the data plotted by this factor.  That
  is, the window height will be the hight of the data multiplied by
  this factor.

variable=bg
type=color
default=white
description
  The background color of the plot.

variable=fg
type=color
default=black
description
  The color used to draw the text and the axes of the plot.

variable=showgrid
type=boolean
onvalue=1
offvalue=0
default=true
description
  This tells whether a grid will be drawn on the plot.

variable=grid
type=color
default=grey82
description
  The color of the grid drawn on each plot.  If you do not want a
  grid to be drawn, unset the showgrid parameter.

variable=c0
type=color
default=blue
description
  The color of the first line drawn in a plot.

variable=c1
type=color
default=red
description
  The color of the second line drawn in a plot.

variable=c2
type=color
default=green4
description
  The color of the third line drawn in a plot.

variable=c3
type=color

description
  The color of the ninth line drawn in a plot.

variable=c9
type=color
default=yellowgreen
description
  The color of the tenth line drawn in a plot.

variable=datastyle
type=list
values=solid dashed dotted dot-dash 
default=solid
description
  This is the line style used to plot the data.

variable=fitstyle
type=list
values=solid dashed dotted dot-dash 
default=solid
description
  This is the line style used to plot the fit.

variable=partsstyle
type=list
values=solid dashed dotted dot-dash 
default=solid
description
  This is the line style used to plot the components of the fit, i.e.
  the paths and the background.

variable=kmin
type=real
default=0
units=inverse Angstroms
description
  The default for the minimum value of a k plot at startup.  This
  value will be overridden by the plot options saved in a project
  file.

variable=kmax
type=real
default=15
units=inverse Angstroms
description
  The default for the maximum value of a k plot at startup.  This
  value will be overridden by the plot options saved in a project
  file.

variable=rmin
type=real
default=0
units=Angstroms
description
  The default for the minimum value of an R plot at startup.  This
  value will be overridden by the plot options saved in a project
  file.

variable=rmax
type=real
default=6
units=Angstroms
description
  The default for the maximum value of an R plot at startup.  This
  value will be overridden by the plot options saved in a project
  file.

variable=qmin
type=real
default=0
units=inverse Angstroms
description
  The default for the minimum value of a back-transformed k plot at
  startup.  This value will be overridden by the plot options saved in
  a project file.

variable=qmax
type=real
default=15
units=inverse Angstroms
description
  The default for the maximum value of a back-transformed k plot at
  startup.  This value will be overridden by the plot options saved in
  a project file.


variable=kweight
type=list
values=0 1 2 3 k
default=2
description
  This sets the default k-weighting used in plots of the data and fits
  in any of the plot spaces. If "k" is chosen, the k-weighting used
  will be determined from the k-weightings used in the fits.  Because
  multiple k-weightings can be specified for a fit, it is useful for
  the plotting k-weight to be determined independently.  What's more,
  it is handy to be able to examine different k-weights easily.  The
  "k" option is a bit confusing, but it is handy in several
  situations, including plots of more than one data set.  In that
  case, the k-weighting can be different for different data sets.  The
  formula for determining the k-weight in the plot when "k" is chosen
  is this: the smallest value used in the fit will be used in the plot
  unless an arbitrary k-weight value is selected in which case that
  will be used in the plot.  This value will be overridden by the
  plot options saved in a project file.

variable=plot_win
type=boolean
onvalue=1
default=false
description
  The default for whether the appropriate window function is plotted
  when a plot is made in any space.


## m e r i p

variable=r_pl
type=list
values=m r i p
default=m
description
  This sets the R-space plotting mode at startup.  This value will be
  overridden by the plot options saved in a project file.  The
  choices are:
  . m  magnitude of chi(R)
  . r  real part
  . i  imaginary part
  . p  phase

variable=q_pl
type=list
values=m r i p
default=r
description
  This sets the q-space plotting mode at startup.  This value will be
  overridden by the plot options saved in a project file.  The
  choices are:
  . m  magnitude of chi(q)
  . r  real part
  . i  imaginary part
  . p  phase

variable=nindicators
type=positive integer
default=8
description
  This determines the number of possible indicators that can be set.
  Changing this parameter will not take effect until the next time you
  start Athena.

variable=indicatorcolor
type=color
default=violetred
description
  This is the color of the plot indicators, which are are used to
  indicate user-defined points in any plotting space whenever new
  plots are made.

variable=indicatorline
type=list
values=solid dashed dotted dot-dash 
default=solid
description
  This is the line style used for the plot indicators, which are are
  used to indicate user-defined points in any plotting space whenever
  new plots are made.




######################################################################
section=data
section_description
  The variables set the default values for the various data processing
  and operational parameters.  These are the parameters that are
  displayed when the anchor in the Data and Paths list is on the data,
  the fit, the background, the residual, a difference spectrum, or a
  prior fit.

variable=fit_space
type=list
values=k R q
default=R
description
  The default value for for a new data set for the data space in which
  the fit is evaluated.  The choices are to fit in original k-space,
  in R-space, or in Fourier-filtered k-space.  The preference of the
  authors of Ifeffit and Artemis is to fit in R-space.

variable=fit_bkg
type=boolean
onvalue=1
default=false
description
  When true, this tells Artemis to flag a data set for background
  co-refinement by default.

variable=kmin
type=real
default=2
units=inverse Angstroms
description
  The default value for the lower range of the forward Fourier
  transform.

variable=kmax
type=real
default=-2
units=inverse Angstroms
description
  The default value for the upper range of the forward Fourier
  transform.  A negative value means that kmax will be that many
  inverse Angstroms before the last data point. 0 means to use the
  value suggested by Ifeffit's chi_noise function will be used.  That
  value attempts to ascertain where the noise in the data exceeds the
  signal.

variable=dk
type=real
default=1
units=inverse Angstroms
description
  The default width of the window sill used in the forward Fourier
  transform. 


variable=kweight
type=integer
default=1
minint=1
maxint=3
description
  The default value of k-weighting to be used in the fit.  By default,
  only a single k-weight is used in the fit.  You can choose to do
  multiple-k-weight fitting by selecting more than one k-weight before
  doing the fit.

variable=rmin
type=real
default=1
units=Angstroms
description
  The default value for the lower range of the backward Fourier
  transform.

variable=rmax
type=real
default=3
units=Angstroms
description
  The default value for the upper range of the backward Fourier
  transform.

variable=dr
type=real
default=0.0
units=Angstroms
description
  The default width of the window sill used in the backward Fourier
  transform. 

variable=kwindow
type=list
default=hanning
values=hanning kaiser-bessel welch parzen sine
description
  The default window type to use for forward Fourier transforms.

variable=rwindow
type=list
default=hanning
values=hanning kaiser-bessel welch parzen sine
description
  The default window type to use for backward Fourier transforms.

variable=cormin
type=real
default=0.25
description
  The is the default value for the smallest correlation reported at
  the end of a fit.  Only correlations whose absolute values exceed
  this value will be reported.  If you set this to 0 or a negative
  number, all correlations will be reported.  If you set it to a
  number equal to or larger than 1, then correlations will not be
  reported.


variable=bkg_corr
type=boolean
onvalue=yes
offvalue=no
default=false
description
  If this variable is true, Artemis will report correlations between
  different background parameters after a fit.  Correlations between
  background parameters and structural parameters are always reported,
  this variable only affects the reporting of background parameters
  with other background parameters.  It is the nature of splines that
  adjacent parameters are highly correlated.  Reporting these
  correlations, which are a natural consequence of the use of a
  spline, does not normally add useful information to the report after
  the fit.  Thus the default is not to report them.

variable=rmax_out
type=real
default=10
units=Angstroms
description
  This is the default value for the maximum value in R-space arrays
  written by Ifeffit.  Thus this sets the upper limit in R of the data
  that can be displayed by Artemis.  If you wish to view the spectrum
  beyond this value, you must increase it. The largest sensible value
  is 31.  Making this smaller than, say, 8 would probably be very
  foolish.

variable=bkgsub_window
type=boolean
onvalue=1
offvalue=0
default=true
description
  When true, this tells Artemis to weight the background by the
  Fourier transform window before subtracting it from the data when
  making background subtracted data.  This might be aesthetically
  appealing if the background is very ill-behaved at and beyond the
  perifery of the fitting region.  However, it is, strictly speaking,
  incorrect to have this true because that the spline function that
  then gets subtracted from the data is not quite the same as the one
  that was refined in the fit.  The bottom line is that background
  corefinement changed slightly in ifeffit 1.2.8 and this parameter
  allows one to tweak the spline in a (possibly) useful way.


######################################################################
section=log
section_description
  These variables determine how the log file is displayed upon
  completion of the fit.

variable=style
type=list
default=raw
values=raw quick column operational
description
  This sets the default style for displaying the log file. "Raw" means
  to display the log file as it is stored in the project.  "Quick" is
  a short summary containing just the fitting statistics and the
  guessed parameters.  "Column" contains all the information from the
  raw log file, but organized in a condensed, columnar format.
  "Operational" shows all the data parameters but none of the guess,
  def, and set parameetrs.  The presentation style can also be changed
  after the log file is displayed.

  These variables determine how the parameters and restraints page
  behaves.

variable=start_hidden

default=project
description
  This variable sets the default behavior for how the Fourier
  transform and fitting parameters are set when data is imported from
  an Athena project file. If this variable is set to "project" the
  parameters from the data group in the Athena project file will be
  used. Otherwise the behavior depends upon the situation. If a new
  data set is being imported, then the preferences will be used to
  determine parameter values. If a data set is being replaced, the
  values in use for the data set being replaced will be retained.

  These variables determine how Atoms behaves in Artemis.

variable=feff_version
type=list
values=6 7 8
default=6
description
  This variable sets which version of feff will be used by and so
  which type of feff.inp file should be written.  The default is to
  write a feff.inp for Feff6 because Feff version 6L is shipped with
  Ifeffit.

variable=template
type=atp
default=feff
description
  This variable sets which Atoms template file should be used for
  generating input for feff.  Typical answers are feff, feff7, and
  feff8, depending on which version of Feff you use with Artemis.  The
  default is "feff" which makes an input file appropriate for Feff
  version 6L, which is shipped with Ifeffit.  The list of possible
  values is constructed from template files found installed with
  Ifeffit along with those you keep in your personal template
  collection.

variable=absorption_tables
type=list
values=mcmaster elam henke chantler cl
default=elam
description
  This variable tells Atoms which collection of x-ray absorption data
  to use for calculations which need it.  The McMaster tables have
  been widely used in the XAS community for years, but the Elam tables
  are more complete.

variable=elem
type=list
values=entry menu menu_sorted
default=entry
description
  This variable determines how element symbols are entered on the
  Atoms page.  The choices are between an entry box (for typing in the

section=autoparams
section_description
  These variables determine how the automated parameter generation
  features in Artemis work. As individual paths and entire Feff
  calculations are imported, it is possible to have path parameter
  values inserted and to have guess and set parameters created, all
  automatically.  Note that automated parameter generation should be
  seen as a broad set of hints.  For first shell analysis, the
  automatically generated parameters might be sufficient for the fit,
  however for a more complex fit these parameters are unlikely to
  fully describe the data.  Hoepfully, though, they will get you
  started fitting your data.

variable=do_autoparams
type=boolean
onvalue=1
default=true
description
  This tells Artemis whether to do automated parameter creation as
  information from Feff is imported.

variable=data_increment
type=list
values=numbers letters LETTERS roman ROMAN
default=numbers
description
  This tells Artemis how to distinguish automatically generated
  parameter names when multiple data sets are imported into Artemis.
  The first set of variables will be given the names specfied by other
  variables in this section.  The variables generated for use by
  subsequent data sets will have a string appended.  This string will
  include and underscore followed by something incremented.  The
  "something incremented" will be either a number, a letter, or a
  roman numeral.  Thus, if the s02 variable name is "amp", the s02
  variable for the second data set will be s02_2 when this variable is
  set to "number".  The possibilities are:
  . number     _2 _3 _4 etc
  . letter     _a _b _c etc
  . LETTER     _A _B _C etc
  . roman      _ii _iii _iv etc

section=paths
section_description
  These variables determine how path information is presented in
  Artemis. 


variable=extpp
type=boolean
onvalue=1
default=false
description
  When this variable is true, Artemis will display the extended path
  parameters on the Paths page.  The extended path parameters are
  dphase, k_array, amp_array, and phase_array.  You can also toggle
  this variable using a checkbutton in the Paths menu.


variable=firstn
type=positive integer
default=10
description
  When importing paths from a Feff calculation by specifying the
  feff.inp file, you have a choice of importing just the first path,
  all paths, or the first several paths.  This variable determines how
  many paths are imported in the last case.

variable=label
type=string
default=Path %i: [%p]
description
  This is the template that will be used for the labels of the
  paths in the Data and Paths List.  The following is a table of
  tokens that will be replaced with data from the path.
  .  %i   path index
  .  %I   index, padded to 4 chars
  .  %p   path geometry
  .  %r   R effective
  .  %n   number of legs
  .  %a   amplitude estimate
  .  %d   path degeneracy
  .  %s   special path
  .
  .
  The %s token will be replaced by "SS" if the path is a single
  scattering paths and by "col." if the path is collinear or nearly
  collinear as determined by the intrp->betamax parameter.  If the
  path is neither single scattering nor collinear, then %s is replaced
  by an empty string.

######################################################################
section=warnings
section_description
  Artemis can do some sanity checks on the evaluations of the math
  expressions defining the path parameters for each path and other
  parameters of the fit.  Some warnings will be issued before the fit
  starts, others will be flagged upon completion of the fit.  The
  parameters in this section define how these various sanity checks
  work.

variable=reff_margin
type=real
default=1.1
description
  Artemis will flag a warning if the Reff of a path is much larger
  than the Rmax of the data set. The default value states that Reff
  can be 10% larger than Rmax before a warning is issued. Setting
  this to a number smaller than 1 is probably a bad idea. Setting it
  to a number much larger than 1 has the effect of turning off this
  sanity check. A number equal to or smaller than 0 will be reset to
  1. 

variable=s02_max
type=real
default=0
description
  This is the maximum sane value for S02.  If S02 for a path evaluates
  to larger than this number, a warning will be issued.  If it is
  zero, then no check will be made on the maximum size of this
  parameter.

variable=s02_neg
type=boolean
onvalue=1
default=true
description
  If this variable is true and S02 evaluates to a negative number, a
  warning will be issued.

variable=e0_max

default=10
units=eV
description
  This is the maximum sane value for the absolute value of e0.  If the
  absolute value of e0 for a path evaluates to larger than this
  number, a warning will be issued.  If it is zero, then no check
  will be made on the maximum size of this parameter.

variable=dr_max
type=real
default=0.5
units=Angstroms
description
  This is the maximum sane value for the absolute value of delta_R.
  If the absolute value of delta_R for a path evaluates to larger than
  this number, a warning will be issued.  If it is zero, then no
  check will be made on the maximum size of this parameter.


variable=ss2_max
type=real
default=0
units=Angstrom^2
description
  This is the maximum sane value for sigma^2.  If sigma^2 for a path
  evaluates to larger than this number, a warning will be issued.  If
  it is zero, then no check will be made on the maximum size of this
  parameter.

variable=ss2_neg
type=boolean
onvalue=1
default=true
description
  If this variable is true and sigma^2 evaluates to a negative number,
  a warning will be issued.

variable=3rd_max
type=real
default=0
units=Angstrom^3
description
  This is the maximum sane value for the absolute value of the third
  cumulant.  If the absolute value of the third cumulant for a path

  it is zero, then no check will be made on the maximum size of this
  parameter.

variable=4th_max
type=real
default=0
units=Angstrom^4
description
  This is the maximum sane value for the absolute value of the fourth
  cumulant.  If the absolute value of the fourth cumulant for a path
  evaluates to larger than this number, a warning will be issued.  If
  it is zero, then no check will be made on the maximum size of this
  parameter.

variable=ei_max
type=real
default=0
units=eV
description
  This is the maximum sane value for the absolute value of the
  imaginary energy correction (Ei).  If the absolute value of the
  imaginary energy correction for a path evaluates to larger than this
  number, a warning will be issued.  If it is zero, then no check
  will be made on the maximum size of this parameter.

variable=dphase_max
type=real
default=0
description
  This is the maximum sane value for the absolute value of the dphase
  parameter.  If the absolute value of dphase for a path evaluates to
  larger than this number, a warning will be issued.  If it is zero,
  then no check will be made on the maximum size of this parameter.

  of checks.  Among these is a check to see that all the data points
  used in the fit have reasonable values for temperature.  If any
  values are larger than this number or less than 0, then the log
  viewer will not attempt to fit and Einstein temperature.  The
  temperatures are determined by harvesting numbers from the names of
  the log files.
