REVISION HISTORY:

version 0.59 (released 08 Apr 2004):
-----------------------------------
1) Extended the DDL1 fix from 0.58 to 
   items within loops
2) Fatal parsing errors now cause the Parser to 
   'die' instead of 'exit' to allow exception handling
   with 'eval' statements in wrapper scripts.
3) Included parseMulti.pl script, a wrapper script
   which attempts to parse all cif files in a given
   directory with multiple command line options.

version 0.58 (released 10 July 2001):
-------------------------------------
1) Added limited compatibility with Data Defition Language 1 (DDL1).
   Earlier versions assumed DDL2-style item names
   with explict category names (_this_category.this_item).
   Now, the category is assigned the default value "-" (minus sign),
   if the item name does not contain a "." (period).
2) Improved proper recognition of "data_" strings as either
   data block headers or other legitimate text, depending on 
   the position in the CIF file. 

version 0.57 (released 15 May 2001):
------------------------------------
A closing semicolon after text that extended over several lines
does not have to be on a line by itelf. This wrong assumption 
from previous versions has been corrected.
