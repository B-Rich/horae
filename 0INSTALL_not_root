        Installing Horae and LibPerlXray and its dependencies
                         without root access


If you do not have root access on your computer, but you want to
download and install all of my stuff and all of its dependencies, you
will have to do some work to prepare your user account. Fortunately, a
clever fellow has already worked out a solution to this problem.  The
trick is to use the local::lib package from CPAN
(http://search.cpan.org/~mstrout/local-lib/).

   1. Go to http://search.cpan.org/~mstrout/local-lib/ and download
      the latest tar.gz file using the link at the top of the page.

   2. Follow the instructions under the heading "To bootstrap if you
      don't have local::lib itself installed", which I will repeat here:

      1. unpack the local::lib tar.gz file that you just downloaded

      2. cd into the local-lib-1.002000 subdirectory (the version
         number might be different...) 

      3. at the command line, enter "perl Makefile.PL --bootstrap"

      4. answer "yes" to the question it asks about configuring CPAN

      5. do make test then make install

      6. finally do

            echo 'eval $(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)' >>~/.bashrc

         This will alter your .bashrc file so that perl will know to
         install modules in your own diskspace and find them there
         once installed. It also exports some environment variables so
         you can run the programs installed by Horae. (See the
         local::lib web page for instructions on how to do this for
         the C shell.)

  3. You will now need to log out and log back in to make this change
     to the .bashrc file take effect. (Logging out and in is not
     strictly necessary, but it's easy and it will certainly work.)



Notes:
======

1. These instructions only apply to perl code.  This procedue will NOT
   help you install PGPLOT or Ifeffit without root access.  For
   PGPLOT, you will need to run the PGPLOT_install script with the
   --prefix command line switch.  For Ifeffit, you will need to run
   the configure script with the --prefix switch.  In each case the
   argument of the switch should be the installation location in your
   personal disk space.  You will then need to set your executation
   path to find the things that get installed.

2. Using local::lib behind a proxy server requires that you handle
   communications through the proxy at the level of the shell. Here at
   Brookhaven, I have the following in my .bashrc file:

      export http_proxy=http://192.168.1.130:3128/
