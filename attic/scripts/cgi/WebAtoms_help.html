      This page provides quick, on-line help for using
      Web<small>ATOMS</small>.  For complete documentation of
      <small>ATOMS</small> and its algorithms, please check out the <a
      href="http://cars9.uchicago.edu/~ravel/software/doc/Atoms/Welcome.html">ATOMS
	documentation page</a>.
    </P>
    <P>
      This page is basically just a big long list of the keywords in
      <small>ATOMS</small> with a few words of explanation.  Just
      enough to get you going.

      <DD>
	<P>
	  Fill in these text fields with the lengths of the unit cell
	  axes.  These should be numbers in &Aring;ngstroms.  For many
	  space groups, it is ok to leave some of these blank.  For
	  example, for the cubic groups, you only need to specify A.
	  For hexagonal and trigonal groups, you need to specify A and
	  C, but you can leave B blank.  For low symmetry groups, you
	  will, of course, need to specify all three.
	</P>
      </DD>

      <DT> <A NAME="alpha"><STRONG>Alpha</STRONG></A> </DT>
      <DD>
	<P>
	  Use this text field to specify the angle between the B and C
	  axes.  This is needed for rhombohedral groups in the
	  rhombohedral setting, triclinic groups, and some settings of
	  some monoclinic groups.
	</P>
      </DD>

      <DT> <A NAME="beta"><STRONG>Beta</STRONG></A> </DT>
      <DD>
	<P>
	  Use this text field to specify the angle between the A and C
	  axes.  This is needed for triclinic groups, and the standard
	  settings of monoclinic groups.
	</P>
      </DD>

      <DT> <A NAME="central"><STRONG>Central Atom</STRONG></A> </DT>
      <DD>
	<P>
	  Choose a site from the list of unique sites to be the central
	  atom of your cluster by selecting the radio button in the row
	  containing that site.
	</P>
      </DD>

      <DT> <A NAME="edge"><STRONG>Edge</STRONG></A> </DT>
      <DD>
	<P>
	  Select a symbol from the popup menu.  This is the symbol of
	  the absorption edge to use when <span
	  class=program>ATOMS</small> writes a <span
	  class=program>FEFF</small> input file.  If you leave the
	  popup widget blank, then <small>ATOMS</small>
	  will choose an edge for you.  If your central atom is
	  lighter than Cerium (Ce, number 58), the K edge will be
	  used.  Otherwise the L3 edge is used.
	</P>
      </DD>

      <DT> <A NAME="element"><STRONG>Element</STRONG></A> </DT>
      <DD>
	<P>
	  Specify the atomic species occupying a site by entering its
	  one- or two letter symbol in this column.
	</P>
      </DD>

      <DT> <A NAME="gamma"><STRONG>Gamma</STRONG></A> </DT>
      <DD>
	<P>
	  Use this text field to specify the angle between the A and B
	  axes.  This is needed for triclinic groups, and the certain
	  settings of some monoclinic groups.  For hexagonal,
	  trigonal, and rhombohedral groups in the trigonal setting,
	  <small>ATOMS</small> will set this to 120 for
	  you.
	</P>
      </DD>

      <DT> <A NAME="output"><STRONG>Output Types</STRONG></A> </DT>
      <DD>
	<P>
	  Use this popup menu to select the type of calculation you
	  would like <small>ATOMS</small> to make.  You
	  choices include input files for <span
	  class=program>FEFF</small>6 and <span
	  class=program>FEFF</small>8, a couple of common file formats
	  for ball-and-stick viewers (alchemy and xyz), a list of the
	  entire contents of of the unit cell (p1.inp), a
	  non-stoichiometric description of the unit cell (unit.dat),
	  some calculations involving tables of absorption
	  coefficients (absorption), and two input formats for the
	  <small>GNXAS</small>' CRYMOL program.
	</P>
      </DD>

      <DT> <A NAME="rmax"><STRONG>Rmax</STRONG></A> </DT>
      <DD>
	<P>
	  This defines the size of the cluster to be calculated by
	  <small>ATOMS</small>.  It should be a positive
	  number in &Aring;ngstroms.  It can also be left blank in
	  which case <small>ATOMS</small> will choose a
	  sensible default.
	</P>
      </DD>

      <DT> <A NAME="shift"><STRONG>Shift</STRONG></A> </DT>
      <DD>
	<P>
	  Some space groups are commonly referenced to a choice of
	  symmetry positions.  If your source of crystal data
	  references the structure to a symmetry position other than
	  the one that <small>ATOMS</small> uses, you will
	  need to specify the vector by which all the unique sites ill
	  need to be shifted so that the calculation will be made
	  correctly.  In most situations it will be clear that you
	  will need to use a shift vector because the atom list in the
	  <small>FEFF</small> input file will be wrong and
	  Web<small>ATOMS</small> will print a little note
	  to you browser.
	</P>
      </DD>

      <DT> <A NAME="tag"><STRONG>Site Tag</STRONG></A> </DT>
      <DD>
	<P>
	  Specify a unique label for a site in this column.  These can
	  be up to 10 characters long.  These tags are used to
	  differentiate between different sites which contain the same
	  atomic species.
	</P>
      </DD>

      <DT> <A NAME="space_group"><STRONG>Space Group</STRONG></A> </DT>
      <DD>
	<P>
	  Use this text field to enter the symbol for the space group
	  of your crystal.  <small>ATOMS</small> is
	  capable of interpreting lots of different things as a space
	  group symbols, including Hermann-Maguin symbols, Schoenflies
	  symbols, numeric indeces from the International Tables, and
	  some special words like "fcc" and "diamond".  You have a lot
	  of latitude as to how you write the symbols.  With only a
	  few obscure exceptions, spaces can be used in writing the
	  space group group symbols or they can be omited.  "pm3m"
	  means the same thing as "P&nbsp;m&nbsp;3&nbsp;m".
	</P>
      </DD>

      <DT> <A NAME="title"><STRONG>Titles</STRONG></A> </DT>
      <DD>
	<P>
	  Use this text field to enter any user-defined title lines
	  that you would like to have printed in the output of the
	  <small>ATOMS</small> calculation.
	</P>
      </DD>

      <DT> <A NAME="xyz"><STRONG>X, Y, and Z coordinates</STRONG></A> </DT>
      <DD>
	<P>
	  Specify the fractional coordinate of a site in one of the cell
	  axis directions.  You may use simple fractions such as
	  "1/2".

    <A NAME="features"><H3 align=center>Features of ATOMS</H3></A>

    <P>
      Although Web<small>ATOMS</small> is pretty handy at
      generating input files for <small>FEFF</small> and
      other interesting kinds of files, there are many features of <A
      HREF="http://cars9.uchicago.edu/~ravel/software/aboutatoms/">
      <small>ATOMS</small> </A> which are only available
      in the version that you download and run on your own computer.
      Here is an incomplete list of features.  Perhaps this will
      entice you to try it out!
    </P>
    <OL>
      <LI>
	<P>
	  Fine grained control over the appearence and content of the
	  output files and the ability to make entirely new kinds of
	  output files.
	</P>
      </LI>
      <LI>
	<P> Dopants can be used. </P>
      </LI>
      <LI>
	<P>
	  Other functionality, such as calculations using tables of
	  absorption coefficients, DAFS simulations, powder
	  diffraction simulations (coming soon), and conversion of
	  molecule files into <small>FEFF</small> input
	  files.
	</P>
      </LI>
      <LI>
	<P>
	  The ability to have <small>ATOMS</small>
	  communicate with you in languages other than English.
	  Currently supported are French, Spanish, and German.
	</P>
      </LI>
      <LI>
	<P>
	  Object oriented perl libraries which you can use in your own
	  programs.
