2002.09.01
  * "Open FEFF calculation" now reads feff.inp or a single
    feffNNNN.dat file.  it does he right thing if the parent feff
    object exists or not.  the "add a feff path" option in the FEFF
    menu is a sort of truncated version.
  * intrp pop-up menu now works correctly for multiple feff
    calculations
  * fixed a bug in the toggle option to select_paths

2002.08.26
  * take a command line argument for a data or project file
  * remember project file name
  * file buttons on feff page are disabled if file does not exist in the -e sense
  
2002.08.20
  * made a generic function for saving the contents of a palette to a
    file
  * added ability to save results to a file.  also added def values to
    the result report
  * issue a useful Echo in situation where unplottable things are
    selected and a plot button is pressed.
  * made the fit and ff2chi buttons a different color (green by
    default) than the plot buttons
  * do a raise for the items in the Edit menu
  * disabled grab buttons for def's
  * fixed some problems deleting a project and opening a new one.
    Also fixed some problems changing path to feff after reading a
    project.
  * added several templates to the templates directory, currently only
    three are working, but I added two as placeholders.


2002.08.19
  * added mouse-3 functionality to intrp box
  * removed mouse-3 functionality from all other text boxes
  * added a crude templating scheme + a menu for templates.

2002.08.16
  * got intrp working on the feff page
  * reformat path page a bit

2002.08.13
  * identify OS, OS version, perl version, and ifeffit version in
    comments at top of project file

2002.08.07
  * fixed a problem which prevented saving path data in any space
  * made several dialog windows raise so they do not get buried on
    Windows 

2002.08.07
  * added a patch found on Usenet which removes much of the looooong
    delay posting certain dialogs (see the end of misc.pl)
  * fixed a problem reading in project files with multiple feff calcs
  * added some mouse-3 functionality to set GDS parameters from the
    the path pages.  this is done by mouse-3 clicking on a word in a
    path parameter math expression on a path page and selecting guess,
    def, or set from the posted menu
  * Added Tk::PathparamEntry to the distro, which inherits from
    Tk::Entry but redefines word boundaries appropriate to Ifeffit's
    math expressions


2002.07.25
  * added Tie::Watch to the distro, needed by Splashscreen


2002.07.22
  * splash screen
  * lots of key bindings + -accelerator tags in menus


2002.07.16
  * don't check excluded paths in verify_parameters
  * I didn't like how "show @variables" would order the things it
    showed, so I now show the variables after the fit making extensive
    use of Ifeffit::get_scalar().
  * erase all background variables before starting a new fit
  * fixed a very silly bug that precluded using third or fourth
    cumulants in fits


2002.07.16
  * titles now getting restored from project files
  * fixed include/exclude by ..., which was broken for all criteria
  * fixed small bug in "Clear math expression for each path" submenu
  * automagically plot data in R when reading a data file, a project
    file, or a feffit.inp (the data file must pass the -e test)
  * buttons in the Plotting options notecards now auto-redisplay the
    plots (also removed envelope option, which doesn't make sense
    alone all by itself -- I need plotting options that combine env
    with other traces) 


2002.07.15
  * finished fixing the "delete feff calculation" problem.  the
    problem was that the path (in the sense of the ifeffit path
    command) needed to be erased when the Artemis path was deleted.
    failing to do so resulted in very strange pathparam values in
    certain situations.
  * allow deleting a feff calculation when one of its paths is
    displayed
  * disallow deleting feff calculation when data is displayed (how do
    I know which feff calc to delete in the case of more than one?)
  * fixed a problem where athena tried to get correlatins between
    things that were not both guess parameters.
  * remember directory after changing path to feff
  * generate_script does not trip if it cannot find an excluded path
    file
  * can now Edit and Export path parameters for a group of selected
    paths
  * can now delete a group of selected paths
  * plot options for plotting space is raised when plotting (i.e. plot
    in R and R plot options are raised) see new meta variable
    plot_tab.
  * fixed a minor display problem in the pathparam right-click menu
  * made a crude fix to a strange problem.  If you read in a project,
    fit without a background, then fit with a background, the array
    containing the background will be corrupted.  Fitting again with a
    background will not show this problem.  The crude fix involves
    copying some arrays around within Ifeffit and, for reasons I don't
    quite grok, avoids having the background chi(k) array be corrupted.


2002.07.14
  * generic message posting routine, used for ifeffit script and error
    messages
  * added hints for Artemis
  * rearranged Guess, Def, Set page
  * "Grab best fit" button now grabs values for def parameters
  * see the first item for 2002.07.02 -- this was also a problem for
    deletion of entire feff calculations
  * added show @groups to the Show submenu

      
2002.07.12
  * added code to check that all guesses and defs are used and that
    all parameters used in math expressions are defined as guesses,
    sets, or defs.  a fault is handled gracefully and a useful error
    message is posted.  functions are also checked against a list of
    valid function names in ifeffit, but the number of arguments is
    not verified


2002.07.09
  * added a check early in the execution of the code that the main
    program and the Path.pm module have the same version number.
    This should help when installation problems crop up.


2002.07.08
  * can now change path to feff calculation while displaying data (or
    fit|bkg|res)


2002.07.07
  * using $plot_devices variable from Ifeffit to construct a list of
    image types on the fly
    

2002.07.02
  * fixed a serious bug in path deletion where the $current variable
    was not reset to the newly selected path.  This resulted in the
    deleted path's entry in the %paths hash "reappearing", albeit with
    an undef value.  This caused serious problems anywhere the %paths
    hash was iterated through with the intent of finding a Path object
    as every entry
  * added a hack to open_project that allows project files from before
    the path deletion bug fix to be read in correctly.


2002.06.20
  * use the "k=" argument to feffit and fftf
  * There is a problem that, in certain situations, the data0.k array
    gets overwritten by the data0.chi array and the data0.chi array
    gets some bizarre values.  This results in a "starburst" plot of
    the data at low k.  This would show up like clockwork by reading a
    project, doing a fit, redoing the fit, then plotting in k.  As a
    crufty solution to this problem, I now reread the data after the
    fit, but before doing the automatic, after-fit plot in the fitting
    space.  This seems to avoid the problem by rewriting over the
    data0.k and data0.chi arrays.  Ugly, but it seems servicable.


2002.06.19
  * change text color for a path in the list when it is excluded from
    the fit.
  * added ability to include/exclude selected paths


2002.06.18
  * fixed a bunch of bugs related to the %paths hash when feff
    calculations are deleted and reread.  A lot of these had to do
    with trying to use parts of the %paths hash which were null or
    which did contain information relevant to the task at hand.  To
    address that I added a lot of conditionals to plotting and
    script-writing chores whenever the keys of %paths are looped
    through. 

2002.06.17
  * fixed several bugs in displaying and using different FT window
    types

2002.06.14
  It's the Mark Jensen commemerative bug day.  All bugs today were
  reported by him!
  * fix a bug which made it impossible to use upper case letters in
    parameter names
  * fixed an obscure bug in fetch_nnnn wherein the path header text
    box would not get filled in in the odd case of running artemis on
    unix and having run feff on windows.  artemis was gettingt
    confused by end of line characters
  * the "View paths.dat" button now looks for paths.dat then
    path00.dat in an attempt to deal with both feff6 and feff8.

2002.06.13
  * renew_data works when feff, path, or bkg|fit|res is anchored
  * include NiCN example
  * interp box a bit smaller

2002.06.11
  * improved input file import, expanded list of properly processed
    keywords, and handle path 0 -- only a few missing keywords, most
    important is include
  * fixed the save data function -- can now properly save data, fit,
    res, bkg, or paths in any space

2002.06.03
  * revamped project file format, got writing and reading working with
    new format
  * made all canvases the same height

2002.05.28
  * Made it so chi(k) data and project files are obtained from the
    same Edit menu item
  * added residuals
    
2002.05.13
  * Initial functional release.

2001.12.24
  * Initial alpha release
  * Run and plot single data set / single feff calculation fits
  * Minimal functionality
