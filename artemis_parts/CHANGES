  * if nothing plottable is selected, plot the first data and its fit
    when clicking a plot button
  * fixed the very buggy export path params cascade in the Paths menu
  * file type in preferences, used for feff_executable, pops up a file

    param not specified
  * option to show x-zero axis in logviewer plots
  * when chi(k) data is imported that needs to be placed on the correct grid,
    save the project data on the grid.

March 28 2006, 0.8.006
  * check that rmin > Rbkg for data imported from an Athena project, also set
    rmin to rbkg when importing from Athena project if bkg_rbkg>bft_rmin
  * check that edge/absorber make sense together when running atoms
  * implemented a pref for how the mru list is displayed

    with a pref for turning it on and off
  * Made the Attention and Running varients of Echo
  * made a standard wrapper around Attention to run every time a
    Dialog is posted
  * fixed a bug writing a parameter report for an after param.

February 6 2006, 0.8.005
  * athena import did not respect clamp1
  * fix_chik macro failed in situation where grid was correct but data did not
    start at 0
  * fixed 2 bugs in intrp method that made it deal incorrectly with
    RMULTIPLIER
  * when importing from an athena project file, there is now an option
    to set parameters as specified in the athena project file, using
    artemis' defaults, or (if replacing data) keeping the current
    values
  * feff warning about atoms being close together might be a red
    herring if hydrogen is in the feff.inp file.  make this warning
    one that does not stop the feff import process.
  * fixed seprator annotations on GDS page (but not retroactively)
  * fixed a bug in deleting a data set from the DPL

January 2 2006 0.8.004
  * disallow spaces in site tags on atoms page
  * fixed problems with multi-component CIF files
  * save a .inp file when the .cif is imported
  * fixed a display problem when a project with atoms.inp and no
    feff.inp is saved then imported
  * preferences for charsize and charfont
  * fixed a bad eof bug in dealing with the contents of the fit
    directory inside a project.  this bug made it impossible to move a
    project from windows to unix!
  * fixed a bug renaming fits for MDS fits -- new name didn't make it
    to all corresponding objects under all data sets
  * fixed a bug in writing log files in the situation where a data
    label contained meta characters
  * work around a weird bug importing athena project data where the
    spline sometimes is not done correctly the first time.  check
    &status -- if it is 2 or more, redo the spline.  silly!
  * avoid a name collision in global parameter name search and replace

October 14 2005 0.8.003
  * implemented weighting of bkg spline by window in bkg subtraction.
    also made a pref to turn this one and off.
  * warn against using variable names that are program variable names in
    ifeffit 
  * function for globally search and replace of a parameter name
  * reorganized GDS context menu
  * handle param guessed as a math expression correctly when parsing in
    ArtemisLog 
  * show nvar and nidp in the Statistical parameters report in log viewer 
  * write after-fit warnings to fit directory and provide a function 
    in Fit menu for redisplaying that file
  * don't try to update fit comment string with current fit index --
    it tended to damage comments with numbers that had nothing to do
    with the fit count
  * save GDS parameter when the big green button is hit while a
    parameter is being edited but has not yet been explicitly saved
  * fixed a problem with uninit values in the logviewer report having
    to do with params guesse as math expressions.  now the report just
    prints out the math exp.


September 15 2005 0.8.002
  * added project location and information content to Properties
  * Properties expands to length of longets string.  Also put the
    props on a Scrolled Pane.
  * fixed a bug involving separators and the BrowseEntry on the log
    viewer page
  * introduced generic_name global so that save_from_palette can use
    the default name from an atp as the initial file name
  * for column view of log file, only write out ei/3rd/4th/dphase
    table if at least one path uses one of those parameters
  * fixed a bug where successive summations could concatinate paths
    rather than actually use the included ones.
  * fixed a problem where a single data set might have its "plot after
    fit" button unchecked and disabled, resulting in no automatic plot
    after the fit.
  * nidp message no longer overwrites the fit warning message in the
    echo area after a fit
  * ability to show and change fit comment.  Put show/change into
    cascade menus for FOM and Comment
  * made an operational view of the log file for a quick view of fit
    and FT parameters

    data section of the log file
  * fixed the long-standing missing ipot problem in atoms by adding
    fix_ipots to ATP.pm

    prefer R-factor and chinu would spew errors if something
    unplottable was in the palette

September 3 2005 0.8.001
  * recall palette size at start up
  * always raise palette after fit or when encounter an error
  * fit-time error dialog pups up under cursor
  * use warning colors in echo area when feffing and fitting
  * added a warning to ParseFeff for exceeding the heap limit in the
    pathfinder
  * export all path parameters in paths menu
  * fixed a situation where the journal might be lost if restoring an
    old fitting model
  * added ^^ to the verify_operators regex (see DR010, item 4)
  * better formatting in GDS show parameters
  * added a resraint builder for guess and def parameters, get there
    from the right click context menu

  * fixed intrp for situation where absorber is not at 000
  * make sure that feff.inp is saved before saving a project
  * finally figured out how to automatically zoom in on the pod text!
  * fixed a bug discarding fits in an MDS fit in situation where some
    fits were not using all the data sets
  * refactored displaying of things in the main and gds HLists

July 16 2005 0.8.000
  * begin adding background tweaking page (commented out for 0.8.000
    release)
  * Added a ParseFeff entry for the situation of atoms too far apart 
    for overlapping to work.
  * reff check only done for a fit, not for a summation, properly sort
    list of paths in warning

  * fixed a problem of not recognizing when ifeffit cannot interpret a
    file as data.
  * toggle modified when clicking the fit kweight checkbuttons

    model
  * make sure that one cannot reuse previous fit after discarding all
    fits
  * made loading STAR::Parser conditional on its installation for
    Debian licensing reasons

April 27 2005  DR 010

January ? 2005  DR 008
  * sum of selected paths regardless of whether it is included
  * move summation cascade from Data menu to its own menu
  * colors indicating SS and collinear in the DPL
  * text indicating path geometry in DPL labels
  * removed count tag from head of fit branch
  * take care with Fit/Sum label at head of fit branch after removing
    fits or when loading a saved project -- this is done with
    $fit{recent} and a small file in the project
  * fixed a bug between SGB and Tk804
  * some geometry changes to the frame (fat is a bit skinnier, start
    the program expanded in x so that DPL is a bit wider)
  * disable/enable entries in the fit menu sensibly
  * added show geometry to the intrp right click menu
  * Added a message to ParseFeff for exceeding the limit of the number
    of atoms in feff.inp
  * fixed a problem parsing numbers from set and def lines in
    ArtemisLog
  * use background2 color for buttons that return from special views
    like prefs and athena
  * quick first shell theory functionality

January 3 2005  DR 007
  * use &max_output_cols for saving selected files
  * make legend location parameters customizable, parameters are in
    the plot section
  * fix lists generated by methods in ArtemisLog so that they are in
    the same order as in the raw log file.  also fixed a problem where
    sets that were set to integers were not being recognized by the
    ArtemisLog parser
  * fixed GDS copy
  * handle the strange sitation of a project with no data included in the fit
    by including then toggling data0
  * fixed a problem doing intrp with the central atom not at (000)
  * fixed problems in intrp-ing keywords above ATOMS when those keywords do not
    have leading spaces on their lines
  * if a project is from a version of Artemis which writes a fit directory but
    does not support fit histories, delete the fit folder as the project is
    imported.
  * fixed a problem reusing a prior fit -- needed to toggle imported,
    imported_bkg, and imported_res flags for the fit so that the new fit would
    get imported into the ifeffit group once the fit was done.  this was a
    very serious problem when reusing right after importing a project.  in
    that case, the fit would not get plotted at all!
  * added radio buttons for chhosing between r-factor and chinu in the log
    viewer, these are disabled unless a report on stat params is made.

November 5 2004  DR 006
  * restore a previous fit (via the Fit menu or the log viewer page)
  * proper control over resizing of main window, can't get smaller,
    can't get taller, if it gets wider the DPL expands to fill the
    extra space
  * get method returns empty string for unused path params
  * fixed reset variables in GDS menu
  * save count_full in the project as a true running tally of how many
    times the fit button has been pressed
  * fixed a bug in the intrp method for feff.inp files that are not
    ordered by distance
  * in delete_feff, compactify when discarding the feff calc, rmpath
    when discarding entire project
  * sort set variables by use to avoid ambiguous definition in ifeffit
  * fixed a bug importing no paths from an existing, imported feff calc
  * fixed a bug adding paths from the intrp page or from the menus
  * added a button to the plot page for plotting a path along with the
    data and fit after the fit finishes
  * added an entry to the intrp context menu for setting paths to plot
    after fit

October 7 2004  DR 005
  * the storage of FT and fit params with a fit was not dealing well
    with the projects.  made a dataN.FT file in the fit folder and use
    dataN params as a default when reading in old project files.

September 7 2004  DR 004
  * import of Athena project files and the dialog for doing it
  * import done in a Safe compartment
  * fixed a bug in ATP.pm in code for finding atp files
  * C-a selects all in the palettes.
  * Fixed a typo in a message during the dicarding of Feff calcs
  * New kind of GDS parameter -- after is a parameter that is evaluate
    upon completion of the fit and reported in the log file.  This is
    like a def, but is not considered in Artemis's error checking
    prior to the fit and is not re-evaluated during the fit.  Made
    appropriate modifications to log file writer and parser, to the
    GDS page, and to the GDS pod.
  * no longer making text on data page change from grey to blue when
    reading data.  just always blue
  * trim the data controls box
  * option to convert unused defs into skips or afters via a dialog
    box that must be answered after the continue/abort dialog box
  * bound mouse buttons to the modified box so that clicking any
    button saves the project in the manner of C-s.
  * redesigned atoms page using HList with extended selection and
    editing area at the bottom of the page
  * save the feff.inp page every time clicking away from the feff
    calc.  this was necessary to not loose changes to the feff.inp
    file when feff does not get run
  * fit info dialog now uses language appropriate to summation when
    making a sum
  * choice of reusing fit slots
  * fixed file type ordering (.chi comes first) for importing project
    data
  * use bestfit values when making a summation, also set bestfit to
    mathexp for guesses by default
  * copy GDS parameter added to context menu

September 6 2004  DR 003
  * increment fit count even in auto-generated labels and comments
  * swapped locations of checkbuttons at top of path page
  * fixed problems discarding fits
  * fixed problems reading DR version number in open_project
  * added some commentary to the fit script
  * most of the Fit menu is now sensible regardless of what is
    anchored -- the latest fit is used if a fit child is not
    anchored. (svn r15)
  * revamped to the feff interpretation page to use an HList, allowing
    for functionality on the extended selection (svn r16)
  * erased all references to chib, cleaned out some commented code
  * fixed various bugs regarding reading project files, dealing with
    log viewer, and cloning feff cacls
  * extended selection and functionality on the GDS page
  * made context menus in intrp and gds pages use anchored item for
    some menu entries when extended selection is in play
  * project compacting


August 31 2004  DR 002
  * fixed a bug in build script cause by Path_dev.pm file.  Changed it
    to PathDev.pm and changed all calls to Ifeffit::Path methods to
    Ifeffit::PathDev
  * fixed save_fit subroutine so it works when something other than a
    fit child is anchored

August 30 2004  DR 001
  * initial release, inmplemented most of fit history system
