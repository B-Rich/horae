These files are all the 60K Fe foil data.  The file extension
indicates which end of line conventions is used.

    unix     \n
    mac	     \r
    windows  \r\n

These files should be imported identically and plot strictly on top of
one another.  Thus, these files test that Athena treats line endings
transparently.
