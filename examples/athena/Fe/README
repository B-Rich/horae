This data set is provided for testing the calibration and data
pre-processing features of Athena.  When these data were collected,
the calibration was intentionally set to be wrong by several volts.
Specifically the peak of the first derivative was set to something
other than 7112 eV.

Read in the `fe.060' and choose the data calibration option from the
Group menu.  Calibrate the data as desired.  Then adjust the
parameters until you are happy.  Next read in the remaining data using
the "Open many files" option in the File menu.  In the "Data columns"
dialog, click on the button labeled "Set preprocessing parameters".
Choose "fe_060" as the standard, then click on the checkbuttons for
aligning the data and for setting parameters.  For this data set, the
auto-alignment algorithm works quite well.

You may also want to merge these data as appropriate and use them with
the example project in the Artemis section of the example files.
