This data set is provided for testing the data pre-processing features
of Athena.  Read in the `fe73ga27.010' and adjust the parameters until
you are happy.  Next read in the remaining data using the "Open many
files" option in the File menu.  In the "Data columns" dialog, click
on the button labeled "Set preprocessing parameters".  Choose
"fe73ga27_010" as the standard, then click on the checkbuttons for
aligning the data and for setting parameters.  For this data set, the
auto-alignment algorithm works quite well.
