* Horae: Very old, unsupported XAS data processing and analysis software

This repository exists to provide a historical record for the
development of Bruce's big XAS software development project.

This software was last updated in 2008 and has been replaced by 
[[https://github.com/bruceravel/demeter][Demeter]]. 

You really shouldn't be using this software.  You really should be
using [[https://github.com/bruceravel/demeter][Demeter]].

More information about Demeter -- including Windows installer
packages and installation instructions for linux and Mac -- can be
found at [[http://bruceravel.github.io/demeter/][the Demetr homepage]].

Final note: quit using this ancient software.  Really.  I mean it.
