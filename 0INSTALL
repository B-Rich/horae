	      Installing Athena, Artemis, and Hephaestus


Do you have root access on your computer?
=========================================

  If the answer is yes and you wish to install all this software to
  system space, then you will need to do all the following steps as
  root.  On some systems, this means becoming root by issuing the "su"
  command and entering the root password.  On systems that use sudo,
  you will need to precede evey command with "sudo" to run it with
  elevated privileges.

  If you do not have root access or if you do not wish to install to
  system space, you will need to follow the instructions in the
  `INSTALL_not_root' file.  The instructions there walk you through a
  procedure for configuring your user account to maintain a local perl
  library.  Once you have done this, you will not need to use sudo to
  run the commands below and all perl software will be installed into
  your own diskspace.


Non-unix operating systems:
===========================

Packages for Windows and Mac OSX are build separately.  See
http://cars9.uchicago.edu/iffwiki/Downloads for details.


Prerequisites:
==============

  You must install all of the follow before building the horae package

  1.  PGPLOT and Ifeffit.
  2.  perl/Tk:
  3.  All perl pre-requisites from CPAN. At the command line issue this command:
           perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::HoraeBundle'
  4.  Bruce's LibPerlXray package of modules.

Installing Athena, Artemis, and Hephaestus:
===========================================

  1. Download the latest version of the Horae from its homepage,
     http://feff.phys.washington.edu/~ravel/software/exafs/

  2. Unpack the archive by issuing this command
         gzip -dc horae.XXX.tar.gz | tar xvf -
     This will unpack the contents to a directory called `horae-XXX/'
     where "XXX" indicates the release number of the latest release.

  3. cd into the `horae-XXX/' directory and issue the following
     commands
         perl Build.PL
         ./Build
         ./Build install
     The last step requires root privilege.  You can alternately
     install into your own diskspace by running the "private-install"
     script. 


You are ready to go.  The executables are called "atoms", "athena",
"artemis", and "hephaestus".  If you use csh or tcsh as your shell,
you will need to type "rehash" if you are installing for the first
time.  You will also have the "horae_update" program installed, which
can be used to update the horae package automagically in the future.

Good luck.  Submit bug reports to bravel@bnl.gov or to the
ifeffit mailing list and be sure to include enough information for me
to replicate the problem.
